Rye

The objective of Rye is to save you time and effort when creating a WordPress site and dosen't make any assumptions about the technology you want to use. The themes that come with WordPress are a great reference, but not a great starter theme. Rye makes it easy to stub out your entire site using the configuration array inside the functions.php file. Enjoy.
